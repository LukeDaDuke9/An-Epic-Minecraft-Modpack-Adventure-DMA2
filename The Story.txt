The Dragon-Lord and the Angulaspis

In ancient times when nought enmenty existed, there was a world of light
Where dragons ruled with wisdom and with might
They built great cities, temples, and machines
They mastered magic, science, and the arts
They lived in harmony with all beings
And shared their knowledge, culture, and their hearts

But in the shadows, lurked a dreadful foe
A serpent called the Angulaspis, who
Had once been a dragon long ago
But lost his wings and scales in an ancient war
He hated all the great lords and their kin
And swore to bring them ruin and despair
He gathered followers of twisted mind
And plotted his revenge with cunning care

Suddenly when the time was right
He launched a sudden, brutal, bloody war
He burned the cities, temples, and machines
He slaughtered magic, science, and the arts of man
And broke the harmony of all things
And stole their knowledge, culture, and their hearts

The dragons fought with courage and with skill
But they were overwhelmed by sheer dread
The Angulaspis had a darkened will
Who showed no mercy to his foes or their will

The last remaining dragon was their lord
A mighty, wise, and ancient one
He faced the Angulaspis with his might
And strove to end the war that ceaselessly raged on

They clashed in a fierce and final fight
They tore the sky with fire and with might
They shook the earth with power and with fight
And ripped the world asunder

The men in arms struck with with sudden horror
The men- they shouteth with their defence in vain
For naut flamming arrow or galdorcr√¶ft would bind the evil one
Then they called upon their lord to find them

The Dragon-Lord was wounded and outmatched
But he refused to leave his people in fire
He gathered all his magic and his power
To make a plan to save his people in this hour

With the last of his might he made a new realm
A place of peace and beauty called Lyrentia
He carried on his back seven lords of his helm
For all else had been blackend with the evil
And flew across the dimensions to escape the Angulaspis' wrath

He left behind a world of dark and dread
A place of chaos and destruction now an Abyss
He sealed the portal with his dying breath
And hoped to find a new world of light

The Dragon-Lord and his seven kin arrived in Lyrentia
They marveled at its wonders and its grace
But then the Dragon-Lord stood still from loss of light
For the evil Angulaspis had cast an unbreakable spell on him from years passed
That once he died, the angulaspis would be reborn with might
And regain his wings and scales with more fight

The men-They vowed- to protect the new realm and sustain its honor
And to rebuild their civilization in this new land
to keep the portal sealed was their thought

Then they mourned their lost world and their fallen friends
They sang their songs of sorrow and of glory
They wrote their tales of heroism and of tragic ends
And they made their epic poem of their story.
