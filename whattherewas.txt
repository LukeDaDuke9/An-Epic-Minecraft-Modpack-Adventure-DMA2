The Dragon-Lord of Lyrentia

He was the Dragon-Lord of Lyrentia
The last of his noble and ancient race
He had escaped the Abyss and its terror
And found a new world of peace and grace

He was the Dragon-Lord of Lyrentia
The guardian of magic and life
He had brought with him seven survivors
And helped them to heal and thrive

He was the Dragon-Lord of Lyrentia
The master of fire and light
He had taught his kin the secrets of the stars
And showed them the wonders of the night

He was the Dragon-Lord of Lyrentia
The leader of wisdom and courage
He had inspired his kin to build a new civilization
And to honor their heritage

He was the Dragon-Lord of Lyrentia
The legend of glory and hope
He had left behind a legacy of beauty and majesty
And a realm of magic and new beginnings.
