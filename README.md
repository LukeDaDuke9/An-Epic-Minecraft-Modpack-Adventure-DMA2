DMA2 - The sequal to Draconic Medieval Adventuring

Purpose- The purpose of this Github page is for the common people to provide advice and support on the development of this minecraft modpack's custom mods
         These mods may be for this minecraft modpack to immerse the player into an epic medieval adventure which would incorporate new mobs, structures/dungeons,
         quest system, and possibly even an itro video into the game (an example of this can be found in the poemIntro document along with some designs). 

If you are interested in helping design and create these ideas into a mod or multiple mods, then feel free to contact me at lukenaegle2006@gmail.com or through github.

At the moment we are expecting to be completed with a beta verson without the video in late 2024.
